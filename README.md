<h1 align="center">Self-Operating Computer Framework</h1>

<p align="center">
  <strong>A framework to enable multimodal models to operate a computer.</strong>
</p>
<p align="center">
  Using the same inputs and outputs as a human operator, the model views the screen and decides on a series of mouse and keyboard actions to reach an objective.

:rotating_light: **OUTAGE NOTIFICATION: gpt-4-vision-preview**
**This model is currently experiencing an outage so the self-operating computer may not work as expected.**
-->

## Key Features

- **Compatibility**: Designed for various multimodal models.
- **Integration**: Currently integrated with **GPT-4v** as the default model, with extended support for Gemini Pro Vision.
- **Future Plans**: Support for additional models.

## Ongoing Development

At [HyperwriteAI](https://www.hyperwriteai.com/), we are developing Agent-1-Vision a multimodal model with more accurate click location predictions.

## Agent-1-Vision Model API Access

We will soon be offering API access to our Agent-1-Vision model.

If you're interested in gaining access to this API, sign up [here](https://othersideai.typeform.com/to/FszaJ1k8?typeform-source=www.hyperwriteai.com).

## Demo

## Run `Self-Operating Computer`

1. **Install the project**

    ```bash
    pip install self-operating-computer
    ```

2. **Run the project**

    ```bash
    operate
    ```

3. **Enter your OpenAI Key**: If you don't have one, you can obtain an OpenAI key [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

    <div align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/OthersideAI/self-operating-computer/blob/main/readme/key.png" width="300"  style="margin: 10px;"/>
    </div>

4. **Give Terminal app the required permissions**: As a last step, the Terminal app will ask for permission for "Screen Recording" and "Accessibility" in the "Security & Privacy" page of Mac's "System Preferences".

### Alternatively installation with `.sh`

1. **Clone the repo** to a directory on your computer:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OthersideAI/self-operating-computer.git
    ```

2. **Cd into directory**:

    ```bash
    cd self-operating-computer
    ```

3. **Run the installation script**:

    ```bash
    ./run.sh
    ```

## Development

We use [PDM](https://pdm-project.org/latest/) as our package and dependency manager. You can find instructions for insallation and usage [here](https://pdm-project.org/latest/#recommended-installation-method).

## Using `operate` Modes

### Multimodal Models  `-m`

An additional model is now compatible with the Self Operating Computer Framework. Try Google's `gemini-pro-vision` by following the instructions below.

Start `operate` with the Gemini model

```bash
operate -m gemini-pro-vision
```

**Enter your Google AI Studio API key when terminal prompts you for it** If you don't have one, you can obtain a key [here](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey) after setting up your Google AI Studio account. You may also need [authorize credentials for a desktop application](https://ai.google.dev/palm_docs/oauth_quickstart). It took me a bit of time to get it working, if anyone knows a simpler way, please make a PR:

### Optical Character Recognition Mode `-m gpt-4-with-ocr`

The Self-Operating Computer Framework now integrates Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities with the `gpt-4-with-ocr` mode. This mode gives GPT-4 a hash map of clickable elements by coordinates. GPT-4 can decide to `click` elements by text and then the code references the hash map to get the coordinates for that element GPT-4 wanted to click.

Based on recent tests, OCR performs better than `som` and vanilla GPT-4 so we made it the default for the project. To use the OCR mode you can simply write:

 `operate` or `operate -m gpt-4-with-ocr` will also work.

### Set-of-Mark Prompting `-m gpt-4-with-som`

The Self-Operating Computer Framework now supports Set-of-Mark (SoM) Prompting with the `gpt-4-with-som` command. This new visual prompting method enhances the visual grounding capabilities of large multimodal models.

Learn more about SoM Prompting in the detailed arXiv paper: [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11441).

For this initial version, a simple YOLOv8 model is trained for button detection, and the `best.pt` file is included under `model/weights/`. Users are encouraged to swap in their `best.pt` file to evaluate performance improvements. If your model outperforms the existing one, please contribute by creating a pull request (PR).

Start `operate` with the SoM model

```bash
operate -m gpt-4-with-som
```

### Voice Mode `--voice`

The framework supports voice inputs for the objective. Try voice by following the instructions below.
**Clone the repo** to a directory on your computer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OthersideAI/self-operating-computer.git
```

**Cd into directory**:

```bash
cd self-operating-computer
```

Install the additional `requirements-audio.txt`

```bash
pip install -r requirements-audio.txt
```

**Install device requirements**
For mac users:

```bash
brew install portaudio
```

For Linux users:

```bash
sudo apt install portaudio19-dev python3-pyaudio
```

Run with voice mode

```bash
operate --voice
```

## OpenAI Rate Limiting Note

The ```gpt-4-vision-preview``` model is required. To unlock access to this model, your account needs to spend at least \$5 in API credits. Pre-paying for these credits will unlock access if you haven't already spent the minimum \$5.
