<h1 align="center">Self-Operating Computer Framework</h1>

<p align="center">
  <strong>A framework to enable multimodal models to operate a computer.</strong>
</p>
<p align="center">
  Using the same inputs and outputs as a human operator, the model views the screen and decides on a series of mouse and keyboard actions to reach an objective.

:rotating_light: **OUTAGE NOTIFICATION: gpt-4-vision-preview**
**This model is currently experiencing an outage so the self-operating computer may not work as expected.**
-->


## Key Features
- **Compatibility**: Designed for various multimodal models.
- **Integration**: Currently integrated with **GPT-4v** as the default model, with extended support for Gemini Pro Vision.
- **Future Plans**: Support for additional models.

## Current Challenges
> **Note:** GPT-4V's error rate in estimating XY mouse click locations is currently quite high. This framework aims to track the progress of multimodal models over time, aspiring to achieve human-level performance in computer operation.

## Ongoing Development
At [HyperwriteAI](https://www.hyperwriteai.com/), we are developing Agent-1-Vision a multimodal model with more accurate click location predictions.

## Agent-1-Vision Model API Access
We will soon be offering API access to our Agent-1-Vision model.

### Additional Thoughts
We recognize that some operating system functions may be more efficiently executed with hotkeys such as entering the Browser Address bar using `command + L` rather than by simulating a mouse click at the correct XY location. We plan to make these improvements over time. However, it's important to note that many actions require the accurate selection of visual elements on the screen, necessitating precise XY mouse click locations. A primary focus of this project is to refine the accuracy of determining these click locations. We believe this is essential for achieving a fully self-operating computer in the current technological landscape.

## Quick Start Instructions
Below are instructions to set up the Self-Operating Computer Framework locally on your computer.

### Option 1: Traditional Installation

1. **Clone the repo** to a directory on your computer:
```
git clone https://github.com/OthersideAI/self-operating-computer.git
```
2. **Cd into directory**:

```
cd self-operating-computer
```

3. **Create a Python virtual environment**. [Learn more about Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

```
python3 -m venv venv
```
4. **Activate the virtual environment**:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
5. **Install Project Requirements and Command-Line Interface: Instead of using `pip install .`, you can now install the project directly from PyPI with:**
```
pip install self-operating-computer
```
6. **Then rename the `.example.env` file to `.env` so that you can save your OpenAI key in it.**
```
mv .example.env .env
``` 
7. **Add your Open AI key to your new `.env` file. If you don't have one, you can obtain an OpenAI key [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)**:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY='your-key-here'
```

8. **Run it**!
```
operate
```
9. **Final Step**: As a last step, the Terminal app will ask for permission for "Screen Recording" and "Accessibility" in the "Security & Privacy" page of Mac's "System Preferences".

### Option 2: Installation using .sh script

1. **Clone the repo** to a directory on your computer:
```
git clone https://github.com/OthersideAI/self-operating-computer.git
```
2. **Cd into directory**:

```
cd self-operating-computer
```

3. **Run the installation script**: 

```
./run.sh
```


## Using `operate` Modes

### Multimodal Models  `-m`
An additional model is now compatible with the Self Operating Computer Framework. Try Google's `gemini-pro-vision` by following the instructions below. 

**Add your Google AI Studio API key to your .env file.** If you don't have one, you can obtain a key [here](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey) after setting up your Google AI Studio account. You may also need [authorize credentials for a desktop application](https://ai.google.dev/palm_docs/oauth_quickstart). It took me a bit of time to get it working, if anyone knows a simpler way, please make a PR:
```
GOOGLE_API_KEY='your-key-here'
```

Start `operate` with the Gemini model
```
operate -m gemini-pro-vision
```

### Voice Mode `--voice`
The framework supports voice inputs for the objective. Try voice by following the instructions below. 

Install the additional `requirements-audio.txt`
```
pip install -r requirements-audio.txt
```
**Install device requirements**
For mac users:
```
brew install portaudio
```
For Linux users:
```
sudo apt install portaudio19-dev python3-pyaudio
```
Run with voice mode
```
operate --voice
```

## OpenAI Rate Limiting Note
The ```gpt-4-vision-preview``` model is required. To unlock access to this model, your account needs to spend at least \$5 in API credits. Pre-paying for these credits will unlock access if you haven't already spent the minimum \$5.
